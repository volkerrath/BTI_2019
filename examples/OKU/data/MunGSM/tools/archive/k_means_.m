% k-means algorithm for cluster sizes of 1-5 only
% INPUTS
% d = dataset
% k = number of clusters (1-5)
% distance (optional) = type of distances for pdist2 - see
% http://uk.mathworks.com/help/stats/pdist2.html for more details
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% example of function:
% k_means_(dataset,3,'euclidean')
% would produce a kmeans clustering algorithm for dataset called dataset
% with 3 clusters using euclidean distance
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

    end

    centroids = zeros(k,2); % initialise empty vector for centroids
    for i = 1:size(centroids,1)
       centroids = rand(k,c); % random initialisation
    end
