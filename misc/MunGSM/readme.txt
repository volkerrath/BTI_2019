The idBTsites.nn* data has
3* 18 timeseries in each line. First 18
entries (after time column) are T_b,
next 18 are ice thickness, then submarine/sublacustrine flags.
Your requested sites are the last 7 of each set.
T_b is the ground surface temperature (ie after TTOP corrections
if subaerial).

order of the last seven time series follows our request: SUL, VAT, ONE, OLK, FOR, VID, LAX
