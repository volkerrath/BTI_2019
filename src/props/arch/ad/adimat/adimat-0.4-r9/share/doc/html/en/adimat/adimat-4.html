<P>It is assumed, that the reader is familiar with the general technique of
automatic differentiation. That is, the keywords independent and dependent
variable and top-level function are familiar to him. If this is not the case,
reading the book 
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#Griewank">Evaluating Derivative</A> or the
papers 
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#Iri">The history od AD</A> or 
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#adifor">ADiFor user manual</A> is adviced.</P>

</H2>


<P>ADiMat applies the source transformation approach of automatic differentiation
to a Matlab program. A Matlab program consists of several files, where one
file is considered to be the one starting the program. This file is called
the 'driver' in the following section. The driver defines all parameters
needed for the program to run and sets up all data. Furthermore, the driver
calls the function(s) to execute the desired operations. We propose to setup
the Matlab program this way, that is, without the need of user interaction,
to simplify its differentiation.</P>
<P>The differentiation of the program is done in four steps (an example will be
shown later on):
<OL>
<LI> Insert the information needed for the differentiation into the driver.
This includes specifying the independent and dependent variables and the
function to be differentiated. Additional options may be given here, too. The
independent variables are declared using the ADiMat directive
'<CODE>%ADiMat AD_IVAR=&lt;ivar_1&gt;, ... &lt;ivar_n&gt;</CODE>'. These
variables have to be used to call the function to differentiate (the actual
parameters). The dependent variables have to be declared using the directive
'<CODE>%ADiMat AD_DVAR=&lt;dvar_1&gt;, ... &lt;dvar_n&gt;</CODE>', likewise.
The top-level function has to be delcared, too. The directive
'<CODE>%ADiMat AD_TOP=&lt;funcname&gt;</CODE>' tells ADiMat about the
top-level function. One top-level function is allowed, only.
</LI>
<LI> ADiMat is executed using the name of the driver as parameter and
specifying the include-path using the option '-I' (see 
<A HREF="adimat-6.html#-I">include option</A>. If all files of the current project reside in the
current directory and no additional files are needed the include path is
'.:@BUILTINS'. The special-tag '@BUILTINS' tells ADiMat, when
to look in the list of functions that are built into Matlab (builtins).
Usually this special tag is the last entry in the include path.

If ADiMat produces any errors, these have to be corrected and ADiMat has to be
reapplied to the program. If ADiMat issues warnings, check the code where
the warnings occured.
</LI>
<LI> Extent the driver to initialise the derivative objects along with the
independent variables. It is recommended to copy the driver to a new file, for
convenience called '<CODE>ad_run.m</CODE>', here. Add the call to the
<CODE>createZeroGradients()</CODE>-function provided with the ADiMat-package, and
initialse the directional derivatives correctly. More information about
the derivative class is provided in section 
<A HREF="adimat-5.html#derivclass">The derivative class</A>.
</LI>
<LI> Run the <CODE>ad_run.m</CODE>-file in Matlab and evaluate the derivatives.
The path to the derivative class of ADiMat has to be set correctly within
Matlab. The Matlab-statement
'<CODE>addpath('${ADIMAT_HOME}/share/adimat/derivclass/');</CODE>'
does the job . Now the <CODE>ad_run.m</CODE>-file may be executed. The derivative
class and its interface is discussed in section 
<A HREF="adimat-5.html#derivclass">The derivative class</A> in greater detail.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

</H2>


<P>The above steps are applied to an example code now, which is introduced by
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#Griewank">A. Griewank: Evaluating derivatives</A> as the
lighthouse example. The function describing the coordinate where the beam of
a lighthouse hits a wall is given by:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
function y=lighthouse(nu, gamma, omega, t)
% The lighthouse example from the book:
% A. Griewank "Evaluating Derivatives" SIAM 2000 p. 16

y(1) = (nu * tan(omega*t))/(gamma-tan(omega*t));

y(2) = gamma*(nu * tan(omega*t))/(gamma-tan(omega*t));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Look into the book for a more detailed description. The driver is given by the
file:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
n= 10; % (m)
g= 0.375* pi; % (bogenmass)
o= 0.0001* pi; % (bogenmass)
t= 2; % (s)

y= lighthouse(n, g, o, t);
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Adding the lines:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
%ADiMat AD_DVARS= y
%ADiMat AD_IVARS= n, g, o, t
%ADiMat AD_TOP= lighthouse

<P>to the above file, tells ADiMat about the (in-)dependent variables and the
top-level function. Invoking ADiMat using the following the command:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
adimat -v10 -I.:@BUILTINS -p ad_out/ driver.m

</P>
<P>The program is differentiated and all output files are written. The
flags supplied at the command line, tell ADiMat to print more
information than usual (the '-v10') and to write all output-files to the
directory 'ad_out/'. If the flag '-p' is not specified the output-files will
be written to the current directory, where they may overwrite existing files.</P>

<P>Next the driver has to be extended to initialse the derivative objects along
with the parameters. In this example the derivatives of the lighthouse
function are sought with respect to all four inputs. Because of this all
input-objects (scalars in this case), need a derivative object, accordingly.
First all derivative objects are initialised using a call to the
createZeroGradients()-functions supplying the number of directional
derivatives desired, and all independent variables. The function returns the
proper initialised derivative objects in the same order the independent
variables were supplied to it. In the example:
<PRE>
[g_n, g_g, g_o, g_t]= createZeroGradients(4, n, g, o, t);
</PRE>

If you mix up the order, it is your fault. There is no way to ensure, that the
derivative object is correctly associated to the independent variable.</P>
<P>In the example each derivative object contains four instances of its
undifferentiated object, because the number of directional derivatives is set
to four in the call of <CODE>createZeroGradients()</CODE>. Each directional
derivative of a derivative object may be adressed using the
cell-array index operator '{ }'. Initialising the directional
derivatives in this example is done by executing the following commands:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
g_n{1}=1;
g_g{2}=1;
g_o{3}=1;
g_t{4}=1;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This process is called 'seeding'. In this example and with this seeding the
influence of n is stored in the first component of every derivative object. This
is because of the choosen seeding and convenience. The second component of each
derivative object stores the influence the variable 'g' has upon this object. If
one would set 'g_g{1}=1;', one would get the influence of the variable
'n' and the variable 'g' in every derivative object. The influence would be
combined in some way depending on the executed function.</P>
<P>After installing the seeding the function-call to the differentiated function
has to be set up. The differentiated function-name is the name of the original
name prefixed with 'g_'. Each active variable in the function call is preceeded
by its derivative object. In the example the function-call looks like this:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
[g_y, y]= g_lighthouse(g_n, n, g_g, g, g_o, o, g_t, t);
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The derivative object of 'y' is constructed by the function and does not need to
be initialized by the user. After execution of this function 'g_y'
stores four directional derivatives. Because of the seeding the first component
stores the influence 'n' had on the result. In our example accessing this
information is done by:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
>> g_y{1}

ans =

   1.0e-03 *

    0.5336 0.6287
</PRE>
</P>
<P>The influences of the other independents may be accessed likewise using the i-th
component, which was used during the seeding of the variable. For more
information about the derivative class see section 
<A HREF="adimat-5.html#derivclass">The derivative class</A>.</P>
