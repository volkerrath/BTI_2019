<P>Matlab enables the use of rather complex formula. These expressions are
unwieldy. ADiMat may break up complex active expressions into many smaller
expressions, this process is called 'outlining' in contrast to the inlining
process performed by many compilers. The 'outlined' subexpressions are
assigned to uniquely generated temporary variables. The temporary variables
are inserted into the complex expression where the subexpression was removed.</P>
<P>This process has some advantages:
<OL>
<LI> during the computation of the derivatives the differentiated
expressions are shorter,</LI>
<LI> the differentiated code is easier to check, and</LI>
<LI> the time to compute the derivative of an expression is reduced, because
instead of differentiating an expression a variable is used.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The decision where to take a subexpression out of the whole expression is made
by rating each item (variable, operator, ...) of the expression using a cost
function. If the costs of a subexpression exceed a user-defineable limit, the
subexpression is outlined. The costs of a subexpression are defined by the
table given below. The costs of each item where choosen with respect to the
expected complexity of the derivative expression. The costs do not reflect a
meassured execution time or likewise. The symbols used in the table are:</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>c</B><DD><P>for constant expressions, like numbers or operations that do not
contain an active variable,</P>
<DT><B>x</B><DD><P>for an active variable,</P>
<DT><B>u,v,w</B><DD><P>for subexpressions that may contain active variables,</P>
<DT><B>f()</B><DD><P>for calls to user-defined functions,</P>
<DT><B>bui()</B><DD><P>for calls to functions that are defined to be built into
Matlab,</P>
<DT><B>u<SUB>c</SUB>,v<SUB>c</SUB>,w<SUB>c</SUB></B><DD><P>for the costs of the corresponding
subexpression,</P>
<DT><B><EM>infinity</EM></B><DD><P>telling that the coresponding expression is outlined
where ever it occurs (See below for more information), and </P>

<P>Two expressions are rated to have infinite costs, because they have to be
outlined whereever they occur. The backslash operator has to be outlined
whereever it occurs, because the derivative expression uses the result of the
original expression y=A\d. The computation of y is
expensive, because the backslash-operator solves the linear equation
A*y=d. Reusing the result is recommended therefore. The second expression
that has to outlined whereever it occurs is the call of a user-defined
function. The differentiated version of a user-defined function returns the
double number of active results. A function that returns only one result in
the original version, returns the original result and a derivative object in
the differentiated version. To get both results of the differentiated version
the function has to be called using an expression like [g&thinsp;y, y]= g&thinsp;f(...).</P>
