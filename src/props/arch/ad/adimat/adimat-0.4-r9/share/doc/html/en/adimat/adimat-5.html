<P>The derivative class is essential for the computation of derivatives. The term
'derivative class' is merely an abbreviation for the underlying functionality.
The derivative class has to be seen as a package containing support functions,
constructor functions, interface wrappers and the Matlab classes needed to run
a differentiated program. Currently two versions of the derivative class
exist. One straight forward implementation resides in the directory
'${ADIMAT_HOME}/share/adimat/derivclass/' and the optimized
version is stored in the directory
'${ADIMAT_HOME}/share/adimat/opt3_derivclass/'. The latter one
is under construction. The straight forward implementation is no longer
maintained. It is usable for simple projects, but will fail for more complex
ones. The 'opt3_derivclass' adds support for two-dimensional derivatives, i.e.
Hessians, and implements several optimizations. </P>

<P>The creation of derivative objects is done using constructor functions. These
functions create seedings that are often used. See section 
<A HREF="#constructorfunctions">constructor functions</A> for more information
on all available functions.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc5.1">Structure of derivatives objects</A>
</H2>

<P>A derivative object should be regarded as a container storing directional
derivatives. Derivative objects are associated to MATLAB-objects, but do not
store references to them. The association is by name only.</P>
<P>A derivative object stores a number of objects in it that have the same shape
as the associated MATLAB-object. E.g., the derivative object <CODE>g_t</CODE>
associated to a 3&times;3-matrix <CODE>t</CODE> stores a number of 3&times;3-matrices.
The number of 3&times;3-matrices stored in the derivative object is defined by
the number of directional derivatives of interest in the program.</P>
<P>Derivate objects may be one- or two-dimensional. One-dimesional derivative
objects are called gradients or Jacobians depending on the context, while
two-dimensional derivative objects are called Hessians.</P>
<P>The data within a derivative object is accessed using the standart Matlab
cellarray-assignment- and indexing-operators. The derivative class is named
'adgradobj' in the old implementation and 'adderiv' in the new one. These
names occur in the list displayed by the MATLAB&apos;s 'whos' command, if
derivative objects are present in the current workspace. Conventionally only
one kind, i.e. only adgradobj or adderiv, should occur. Intermixing them is a
bad idea.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc5.2">Creation of derivative objects</A>
</H2>


<P>Derivative objects are created using constructor functions.
'<CODE>createZeroGradients()</CODE>' is one of them. The function is able to
initialise several derivative objects at once and may be called several times.
If calling the function several times, the number of directional derivatives
has to be the same in each call. Additional constructor functions exist, see
section 
<A HREF="#constructorfunctions">Constructor functions</A>.</P>

<DT><B>Description:</B><DD><P>This function initialises one or more derivative objects. The
number of directional derivatives created per derivative object is denoted by
the parameter '<CODE>ndd</CODE>'. If using the vectorised call---the upper one---, the

is why this function is named <CODE>create<B>Zero</B>Gradients()</CODE>.</P>
<P>All derivative objects have to store the same number of directional
derivatives. It is therefore advised to use the vectorised function, which
ensures that all derivative objects have the same number. It may be possible
to change the number of directional derivatives in future version of ADiMat,
but upto now this is not supported. Messing around with the number of
directional derivatives during one run of the differentiated program is done
on your own risk, so do not complain about wrong derivatives.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss5.3">5.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc5.3">Accessing the derivative data</A>
</H2>


<P>Each derivative object is an object of the user-defined Matlab-class
'adderiv'. This class overloads several operators and (re-)implements some
functions. The cellarray-indexing-operator '{n}' is the most
interesting operator to access the data within a derivative object.
Additionally a '<CODE>get()</CODE>' method is implemented, which basically does the
same job. The drawback of the <CODE>get()</CODE> method is, that it implements a
restricted set of adressing only. I.e., it is not possible to select the third
derivative of an object and get ist (2,3)-th element in one statement.</P>

of an object '<CODE>g_v</CODE>'.</P>

<DT><B>Description:</B><DD><P>The cellarray-indexing-operator either in assigning mode or
in referencing mode is used to assign data to a directional derivative or to
read it, respectively. If the expression '<CODE>g_v{n}</CODE>' appears on
the left-hand side of an assignment the cellarray-indexing-operator is in
assigning mode. If the expression occurs on the left-hand side of an
assignment or in no assignment at all, it is treated to be in referencing
mode.</P>
<P>Indexing operators may be concatenated. Suppose that v is a higher
dimensional object, a vector for example. The expression
'g_v{i}(j)' accesses the j-th element of the i-th
directional derivative of the object '<CODE>g_v</CODE>'. This is possible in assigning
and in referencing mode.</P>

<DT><B>Examples:</B><DD><P>The cellarray-indexing-operators are often used to do the seeding or to look
at one directional derivative. The example presented with the
<CODE>createZeroGradient()</CODE>-function is repeated here to show one possible
seeding to get the desired derivatives. Remember the derivatives of interest
are the first three entries of the vector v and the scalar. Create the

<DT><B>structures: struct.field</B><DD><P>Structures enable the storage of distinct data in a hierarchical way. The

the variable storing the structure, is a derivative object. This has to be
taken into account when creating structures that are active and the derivative
has to created. At first a dummy-derivative objects has to be created and then
the fields have to be inserted. In this way a structure is stored within a
derivative object. The other way around, a derivative object is not to be
stored within a structure. This is enforced, because during the activity
analysis of the source transformation component the variable containing the
