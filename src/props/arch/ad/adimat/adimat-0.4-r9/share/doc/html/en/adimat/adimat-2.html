<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc2.1">How to obtain ADiMat</A>
</H2>

<P>Currently ADiMat is available only by contacting the author.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc2.2">Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>ADiMat was successfully compiled on:
<UL>
<LI>Intel series PCs running Fedora Core 1 Linux systems using gcc 3.3.2.</LI>
<LI>Intel series PCs running Windows 2k and Cygwin 1.5.5-1 using gcc 3.3.1.</LI>
<LI>Intel series PCs running Windows 2k with mingw32-support.</LI>
<LI>Intel series PCs running RedHat 8.0 Linux systems using the gcc 3.2 and
3.2.2.</LI>
<LI>Intel series PCs running RedHat 7.1 Linux systems using the gcc 2.96 and
3.0.1.</LI>
<LI>Sun UltraSparc III running Solaris 8 (SunOs 5.8) using Sun Workshop 6
update 2 C 5.3 and gcc 2.96.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The c-code of the scanners and parsers used by this application may be
obtained from their specification files using bison &gt; version 1.28 and flex
&gt; version 2.5.4. The c-source files of all scanners and parsers are
distributed in the tar-ball. Therefore, bison and flex are only needed,
if the scanner&apos;s or parser&apos;s specifications are modified.</P>
<P>Matlab version 6 or higher is of course needed to run the resulting code.
Rumors are that ADiMat runs with Matlab version 5, too. But this not
officially supported.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc2.3">Compilation and installation on Unices</A>
</H2>


<P>In order to compile and install ADiMat on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the ADiMat distribution:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
% ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
% make
% make install
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Now all files are where they got to be, but Matlab does not know about ADiMat
yet. This can be accomblished in many ways. Some are shown here exemplarily:
<UL>
<LI> Use the startup_ADiMat.m file: In the directory
${prefix}/share/adimat/opt_derivclass the file startup_ADiMat.m tries
to find the ADiMat executable and inserts the path into Matlab. Copy the file
to your $HOME/.matlab directory and call it by adding the line
startup_ADiMat to your personal startup.m file.</LI>
<LI> Add an addpath-line to your personal startup.m: Add the line
'addpath('$prefix/share/adimat/opt_derivclass');' to your startup.m
file.</LI>
<LI> If have the permission to modify the Matlab installation add the
addpath directive to the installation. (We do not describe it in more detail
assuming that an adiminstrator knows were to find the appropiate file and
stopping the unexperienced user from corrupting his Matlab installation.)</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>If you habe choosen a different installation directory then /usr/local, do
not forget to set the ADIMAT_HOME environment variable appropiately. (Setting
this variable in the shell startup files is a good idea in any case.)</P>


<P>Since ADiMat uses 
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#autoconf">autoconf</A> there should be no
trouble compiling it. If you run into problems please report them to the
author 
<A HREF="mailto:vehreschild@sc.rwth-aachen.de">Andre Vehreschild</A></P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc2.4">Installation on Windows</A>
</H2>


<P>Installation on Windows is done by a setup.exe. Administrator-privileges are
needed to sucessfully install ADiMat, because a new toolbox is added to the
directory of Matlab and some information is stored in the registry. The
installation is done by a setup-program, because several components have to be
installed and each component has to know where its parts are located.</P>
<P>Execute the setup.exe as user Adiministrator or as any other user, who has the
privileges to write into the Matlab directory and modify the Windows registry.
The setup tries to find the most recent version of Matlab on your system. Then
it displays a dialog to choose the installation location. It is recommended
that ADiMat is installed in the Matlab toolbox directory, but another location
is possible, too. Next the groupname has to be selected. This is the name
ADiMat is refered to in the Windows start-menu. In this group a link to this
documentation is installed and a link to the uninstall application.</P>
<P>The next setup dialog page cares about the <B>integration of ADiMat into
MATLAB</B>. Because ADiMat is a MATLAB toolbox, this has to be introduced to
MATLAB. That is, the directory where the MATLAB files of ADiMat are stored has
to be added to MATLAB&apos;s search path. The dialog page offers at least two
possibilities to do this for you:
<UL>
<LI> Do not integrate. : The setup will not add the path of the ADiMat
installation to the search path of Matlab. You have to do it yourself to get
ADiMat running. This option is the fall-back if any of the other options
failed.</LI>
<LI> MATLAB X.X in (C:\someplace\somewhere): Setup integrates ADiMat in this
Matlab version in the named install location by adding the file adimat.phl to
C:\someplace\somewhere\toolbox\local\path and modifying the file pathdef.m in
C:\someplace\somewhere\toolbox\local.</LI>
<LI> Modify startup.m in personal work directory. : This options prompts
for a directory you keep your Matlab work files and esp. your startup.m file
in and adds an 'addpath(...)' command to this file. The file is created, if
it does not exist jet.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>The next page gives a summary of all options selected. Clicking 'Install'
starts the installation and the files are copied. Errors, hopefully none, are
prompted in a seperate message box.</P>
<P>ADiMat installs an uninstall feature. This programs enable a complete
removal of ADiMat, so do not delete any of its components manually.</P>

<H3>Windows installation without Adiminstrator privileges</H3>


<P>Installation of ADiMat on Windows systems without Adminstrator privileges is
possible, too.</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Select an installation directory where you have write permissions.</LI>
<LI>Select a groupname as above.</LI>
<LI>Select 'Modify startup.m in personal work directory'.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>The setup will complain about being unable to modify the registry, select
'Ignore' to proceed. All files are installed now. Usually ADiMat stores its
installation path in the registry. Due to not being able to do this, the user
has to tell ADiMat, where it is installed by setting the environment variable
ADIMAT_HOME to the path of adimat root directory (e.g:
&apos;C:\User Data\Some User\adimat\&apos;). Environment variables can be
set using the <B>set</B> command in a .bat file, or in the enviroment
preferences of the current user. Because of the many variants of
Windows-systems we can not describe here it for every system.</P>
