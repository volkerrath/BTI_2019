<P>ADiMat uses command line options or directives within the parsed sources to
configure its behavior. In section 
<A HREF="#directives">Directives</A>
directives are described in greater detail. A command line option is
overriden by the directives specified in the source files. If a command line
option or directive occurs several times, the last occurrence is used. The
usage is:</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
adimat [options] inputfilename
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Most options have a short and a long name. This way '-h' and '--help' have
the same meaning. (Long options are prefixed by two '-', only in case it is
undistinguishable in the printout.)</P>
<P>The available options with the same meaning are enumerate here. A commata ','
is used to seperate options having the same meaning. Directives are named
with their corresponding option embracing them in square brackets
[...]. Default values are written in braces (&lt;N&gt;=6).</P>

<DT><B>-p&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;, --outputpath=&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;,
[AD_OUTPUT_DIR=&quot;&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;&quot;]</B><DD><P>The path where ADiMat puts the augmented files. (&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;='.')</P>
<P>ADiMats default is the local directory, but it is not really clever to use it,
because ADiMat will produce a huge number of files. It may overwrite some
existing files, too. Using a subdir is highly encouraged. The subdir has to
exist, it will not be created.</P>

<DT><B>-d&lt;DVARLIST&gt;, [AD_DVARS=&lt;DVARLIST&gt;]</B><DD><P>Specify the list of dependent variables. This flag is only read if the
<CODE>inputfilename</CODE> specifies a file containing a function. The flag can be
used to select some or all of the variables of the result list of the function
to be dependent variables. If the flag is not specified and the inputfilename
specifies a function, then all results are treated to be dependent variables.
<B>The command line switch overrides the directive AD_DVARS!!!</B></P>

<DT><B>-i&lt;IVARLIST&gt;, [AD_IVARS=&lt;IVARLIST&gt;]</B><DD><P>Like -d but for the independent variables. All parameters are selected to be
independent, if the inputfilename is a function and the flag is not given.
<B>The command line switch overrides the directive AD_IVARS!!!</B></P>

<DT><B>-I&lt;PATH&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="-I"></A>  Add the directories given in &lt;PATH&gt;to the path, where ADiMat looks for matlab m-files. The option -I&lt;PATH&gt;
may occur more than once. The valid paths of each occurrence of -I&lt;PATH&gt;
will be appended to the list of directories scanned for missing functions.
Invalid paths will be discarded. Environments variables are valid and will be
expanded. The special tag '@BUILTINS' may be inserted anywhere, but it is not
allowed to habe more than one occurrence of it in the list. &lt;PATH&gt; may
contain multiple directories seperated by colons ':'.
(&lt;PATH&gt;='.:@BUILTINS')</P>

<DT><B>--noforwardvarresolv, [GLOBAL NOFORWARDVARRESOLVE]</B><DD><P>This options prevents that ADiMat looks forward in the code to learn, if an
unknown identifier is a variable. For example in: 'b=a; a=5;' the 'a' in 'b=a'
is bound to the same 'a' as in 'a=5'. This, of course, is an error in this
case, because 'a' was not defined before use. The flag exists for the rare
situations, where a function has the same name, like a variable and the
variable is defined later on. Consider this bad programming style.</P>

<DT><B>--writescopefile, [GLOBAL WRITESCOPEFILE]></B><DD><P>
<A NAME="writescopefile"></A> </P>
<P>Write the file '&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;/adimat.dbg' which contains information about
the scopes and the identifiers bound in them. The file contains a history of
the identifier resolution process. This file is for debugging purpose only, it
is not needed by the differentiated program. If this option is available your
version of ADiMat was compiled with the DEBUG-symbol set.</P>

<DT><B>--nobuiltins, [GLOBAL NOBUILTINS]</B><DD><P>Skip any builtin-files. Even if there is a different builtinfilelist given,
the builtin-files and '%ADiMat B*'-directives in the code are ignored.
Use this option with great care. The builtin-files define many
Matlab-functions that are used often (see section 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#builtins">builtins</A> for further information).</P>

<DT><B>--builtinspath=&lt;BUILDINSPATH&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="builtinspath"></A> </P>
<P>This path is scanned for the builtins-declaration file 'ADiMat.amb'. Specifing
a new path discards the old one. Look at 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#builtins">builtins</A>

(&lt;BUILTINSPATH&gt;='${ADIMAT_HOME}/share/adimat:~/.adimat:.').</P>

<DT><B>--exportctvcg=&lt;FNAME&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="expctvcg"></A>  Write the calltree of
the functions to the file &lt;FNAME&gt;. The file will be written to the
&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;. No absolute paths are possible, only paths relative to the
&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;. The calltree is stored using the vcg format. The file gets
the suffix '.vcg'. See section

information.</P>

<DT><B>--exportctsimp=&lt;FNAME&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="expctsimp"></A>  Write the
information gathered about caller-callees dependencies between function (the
calltree) to the file &lt;FNAME&gt; in a simple text fashion. This file is
intended for use with other programs, use --exportcttxt for a more human
readable format. No suffix is appended to the filename. The file is put into
the &lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;. No absolute paths are allowed here. See section 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#calltree">calltree</A> for more information.</P>

<DT><B>--exportcttxt=&lt;FNAME&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="expcttxt"></A>  Write the calltree to
the file '&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;/&lt;FNAME&gt;' in a human readable format. No
suffix is appended, but '.txt' is proposed here. See section 
<A HREF="adimat-8.html#calltree">calltree</A> for more information.</P>

<DT><B>--exportdgvcg=&lt;FNAME&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="expdgvcg"></A>  The dependencies
between all variables of the current project are written to the file
'&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;/&lt;FNAME&gt;'. The filename-suffix '.vcg' is ensured. The
variable dependency graph is only available in this format, because it is
huge most of the time and other formats are not applicable. For documentation
of the vcg format see section 
<A HREF="adimat-13.html#vcg">VCG</A>.</P>

<DT><B>--nolocalmfiles, [GLOBAL NOLOCALMFILES]</B><DD><P>Files that contain only statements and no function declarations are normaly
copied into the scope they are called from and the file is renamed to meet the
pattern: &lt;calling_function_name&gt;_&lt;original_filename&gt;. However, in
some circumstances this may not be desired. Using this switch, will prevent
the localization of these files. But make sure, that no activ variables
are used or altered in the command-file. (The default is to use local
files.)</P>

<DT><B>--envoutput, [GLOBAL ENVOUTPUT]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="envoutput"></A> </P>
<P>This option writes more information about each identifier into the m-files
written by ADiMat. The files are no longer Matlab-complient than. This option
is for debuging purpose only. If this option is available your executable was
compiled using the DEBUG-flag.</P>

<DT><B>--gradprefix=&lt;PREFIX&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="gradprefix"></A> </P>
<P>This prefix is added to each active variable. The prefix is used for variables,
when ADiMat is in forward mode. (&lt;PREFIX&gt;='g_')</P>

<DT><B>--hessprefix=&lt;PREFIX&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="hessprefix"></A> </P>
<P>If the 
<A HREF="#secondorderfwd">second order forward mode</A> flag is set,
then this prefix is used to preceed the variables that store Hessians.

<DT><B>--funcprefix=&lt;PREFIX&gt;</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="funcprefix"></A> </P>
<P>The prefix is added to each function that is augemented in forward mode. There
is no distinction between functions that are differentiated once or twice.
They all get this prefix.
(&lt;PREFIX&gt;='g_')</P>

<DT><B>-f, --forward-mode, [GLOBAL FORWARD-MODE]</B><DD><P>Differentiate using the forward mode. This is the only mode available
currently. This mode is the default, therefore.</P>

<DT><B>-r, --reverse-mode, [GLOBAL REVERSE-MODE]</B><DD><P>Differentiate the functions using the reverse mode. This mode is not available
yet. The flag is introduced to prevent using it for other purposes. The mode
will be forced to forward even if this flag is used.</P>

<DT><B>-m, --hybrid-mode, [GLOBAL HYBRID-MODE]</B><DD><P>Differentiate the project using forward and reverse mode interchangeably. The
decision when to switch modes is not yet defined. This flag is non-functional.
It is defined to prevent future misuse. The mode will be forced to forward
even if this flag is used.</P>

<DT><B>--outl_comp=&lt;NUM&gt;</B><DD><P>Set the limit when a subexpression is truncated to the number given by
&lt;NUM&gt;. See section 
<A HREF="adimat-9.html#outlining">outlining</A> for further
information. (&lt;NUM&gt;=1)</P>

<DT><B>--nooperoptim, [GLOBAL NOOPEROPTIM]</B><DD><P>During differentiation operations like a*b*c are joined to a single subroutine
call times3(a, b, c) if a derivative object is involved. This flag prevents
the optimization.</P>

<DT><B>--nolocalcse, [GLOBAL NOLOCALCSE]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="nolocalcse"></A> </P>
<P>ADiMat splits up expressions that consist of more than one operation into many
small expressions. Each expression is assigned to a temporary variable. While
ADiMat operates on one such big expression it may encounter, that the same
small expression is found several times. Instead of recomputing it each time,
the expression is evaluated only once and the temporary variable is inserted
multiple times into the expression. This switch turns this behaviour off. It
may be of use if a function that manipulates a global variable is called
multiple times.</P>

<DT><B>--noglobalcse, [GLOBAL NOGLOBALCSE]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="noglobalcse"></A> </P>
<P>Similiar behaviour like 
<A HREF="#nolocalcse">--nolocalcse</A>, but this
time not only the expressions, which are generated during splitting the bigger
expressions are taken into account. ADiMat will look at all expression in the
program and replaces expressions which compute the same values with a
temporary variable. The value of the temporary variable is then computed only
once. This feature is switched off, whenever the flag --nolocalcse or its
corresponding directive is used. Use this flag, if you use functions which
have sideeffects and you encounter a wrong program behaviour after
differentiation. !!! This flag is default currently due to a deficiency in the
implementation. !!!</P>

<DT><B>--globalcse, [GLOBAL GLOBALCSE]</B><DD><P>Explicitly switch on global common subexpression elimination. Danger!!! The
algorithm is buggy. Use at your own risk.</P>

<DT><B>--noloopsaving, [GLOBAL NOLOOPSAVING]</B><DD><P>ADiMat uses so called loopsaving operators when invoked without this flag. A
loopsaving operator enables faster derivative computation, because several
loops are joined togehter into one loop, therefore reducing the number of
cycles needed. It is usually not a good idea to switch of the feature, because
the differentiated code will perform badly then.</P>

<DT><B>--nooverwrtchk, [GLOBAL NOOVERWRITINGCHECK]</B><DD><P>Prevents "update" of variables. An expression <CODE>v=v*...;</CODE> is called an
update of <CODE>v</CODE>. This is a bad idea, because <CODE>v</CODE> is most likely used in
the derivative computation of <CODE>g_v=...</CODE>. The outcome of the expression will
be assigned to a temporary variable. The temporary will be assigned to <CODE>v</CODE>
in a successive statement. This switch turns off the check for variable
updates. Again, be carefull if you use this switch.</P>

<DT><B>--2ndorderfwd, [GLOBAL SECONDORDERFWDMD]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="secondorderfwd"></A> </P>
<P>Insert statements to compute second order derivative using forward mode. In
fact, the routines to compute first order derivatives are simply repeated once
more.</P>

<DT><B>--parentcheck, [GLOBAL PARENTCHECK]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="parentcheck"></A> </P>
<P>Switch on parent checking in AST. This is flag is available only, if ADiMat
was compiled with DEBUG-support. The check is done directly after all files
are read.</P>

<DT><B>--canonparentcheck, [GLOBAL CANON_PARENTCHECK]</B><DD><P>Check that the AST is correctly linked. The check is applied after code
canonicalization. Debugging.</P>

<DT><B>--postparentcheck, [GLOBAL POST_PARENTCHECK]</B><DD><P>Check correct linking of the AST after augmentation and shortly before output.
Debugging.</P>

<DT><B>--allparentchecks</B><DD><P>Use all of the above checks. This flag is available only, if ADiMat was
compiled in DEBUG mode.</P>

<DT><B>--noscalarfolding, [GLOBAL NOSCALARFOLDING]</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="noscalarfolding"></A> </P>
<P>Suppress folding of constant real scalar expressions. Scalarfolding examines
expressions and computes the result of constant expressions, like <CODE>3+4</CODE>.
This option disables all folding of scalar values.</P>

<DT><B>--noprescalarfolding, [GLOBAL NOPRESCALARFOLDING]</B><DD><P>Suppress scalar folding before the augmentation step.</P>

<DT><B>--nopostscalarfolding, [GLOBAL NOPOSTSCALARFOLDING]</B><DD><P>Suppress scalar folding after the augmentation step. It is not advisable to
switch of scalarfolding, because ADiMat will generate some constant
expressions, e.g. <CODE>2*x^(2-1)*g_x</CODE> for the derivative of <CODE>x^2</CODE>, where a
constant term could be eliminated. Use this switch if you believe, that ADiMat
does incorrect folding.</P>

<DT><B>--noconstfoldmult0, [GLOBAL NOCONSTFOLDMULT0]</B><DD><P>Suppress folding of expressions with one factor being zero. ADiMat usually
folds products of the kind <CODE>bar= foo*0</CODE> to <CODE>bar= 0</CODE>. In some special,
and seldom cases this may be undesireable. E.g. if foo is a function call
having side effects.</P>

<DT><B>--nonargsupport</B><DD><P>Suppress the generation of mapping arrays for nargin and nargout identifiers.
In MATLAB a function can check how many arguments are set by the calling
context by checking the nargin identifier. During augmentation the parameter
list is changed. The mapping arrays take care about mapping the number of
arguments correctly to the number of arguments the code expects without the
derivative objects in the parameter list. Usually there is no need to
deactivate generation of narg-mapper.</P>

<H2><A NAME="directives"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc6.2">Directives</A>
</H2>


<P>Directives are Matlab-comments starting with the keyword 'ADiMat'. A directive
is used to manipulate the behaviour of ADiMat during its run. Nearly all
directives may appear anywhere in the code. The expections from this rule are
the directives starting with the prefix 'AD_'. They have to appear in the
first input file given to ADiMat. An occurrence in any additional file is not
forbidden, but does not make any sense.</P>
<P>Directives used to switch a specific feature on or off are named together,
seperating them using a commata. Some features of ADiMat may be selected
using a command line option or a directive. The directive overrides the
command line option in every case. The corresponding command line option is
named with its directive, respectively. The directives available are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<DL>

<DT><B>AD_TOP=&lt;FUNCNAME&gt;</B><DD><P>The name of the function to differentiate. The function has to be called in
the current file using the variables defined as independent or dependent ones
using the AD_IVARS- and AD_DVARS-directives, respectively. This directive is
mandatory in the first file parsed by ADiMat.</P>

<DT><B>AD_IVARS=&lt;IVARLIST&gt;</B><DD><P>Specifies the list of independent variables. The variables with which a
function is differentiated with respect to are called independent variables.
Multiple variables may be named here using a commata ',' to seperate them.
This directive is mandatory in the first file ADiMat reads.</P>

<DT><B>AD_DVARS=&lt;DVARLIST&gt;</B><DD><P>Specifies the list of output variables of the top-level function for which
derivatives are sought. More than one variable may be named by seperating each
using a commata ','. This directive is mandatory in the file supplied at the
command line when calling ADiMat.</P>

<DT><B>AD_OUTPUT_DIR="&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;"</B><DD><P>All files that are written by ADiMat will be created in the directory given by
&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;. Please note the double quotes around the &lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;.
These are mandatory, because without them a slash within the directory would
be considered to be the division-operator. The directive is only usefull in
the first file of the current project to differentiate. It is optional, but
overrides the '-p' or '--outputdir' flag of the commandline.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL FORWARDMODE, GLOBAL FORWARD-MODE</B><DD><P>Select the forward mode of automatic differentiation. Currently this flag has
a global scope, that is, specifying it anywhere will switch the mode of
differentitation of the current project to forward mode. Until now no
alternative modes are implemented, the directive may be obmitted therefore.
But it is considered good style to specify it, if a project is to be
differentiated using forward mode anytime. The command line switches overriden
by this directive are: '-f', '--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m'
and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>


<DT><B>GLOBAL REVERSEMODE, GLOBAL REVERSE-MODE</B><DD><P>This directive is non-functional currently. The reverse mode of automatic
differentiation is not implemented yet. Specifying this flag, yields a
warning, but ADiMat continues to differentiate the current project using the
forward mode.The command line switches overriden by this directive are: '-f',
'--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m' and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL HYBRIDMODE, GLOBAL HYBRID-MODE</B><DD><P>Same like reverse mode. Not implemented yet. Specifying it, results in a
warning. The command line switches overriden by this directive are: '-f',
'--forward-mode', '-r', '--reverse-mode', '-m' and '--hybrid-mode'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOFORWARDVARRESOLVE, GLOBAL FORWARDVARRESOLVE</B><DD><P>This directive is implemented for highly sophisticated code (also called
<I>bad style code</I>). In Matlab it is possible to use an identifier as a
function and
later on to denote a variable. This is considered bad style, but supported by
ADiMat. The standart behaviour of ADiMat is to look forward in the parsed code
to find a defining occurrence of an identifier (that is, a left-hand side
occurrence of a variable). That is, in the example 'b=a; a=3;' ADiMat will
treat the first 'a' like the second one, allthough 'a' was not defined before
first use. A warning will be issued. Note, it may not be an error that a
variable occurs in a using context before it is defined, think about an
'if then else'- construct, where the variable is defined in the else part
and used only in the then part. For common codes the directive
'GLOBAL FORWARDVARRESOLVE' is suitable, which is the default. If a code
fails to be parsed, because of problems during the identification of the
identifiers, try this directive. This directive overrides the command line
option '--noforwardvarresolve'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL WRITESCOPEFILE</B><DD><P>Write the file '&lt;OUTPUTDIR&gt;/adimat.dbg' which contains debuging
information about the binding of identifiers. This directive is for debugging
use only.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOBUILTINS</B><DD><P>Switch off the builtin system. This is no good idea! Specifying this option
hinders ADiMat&apos;s use of derivative information stored in the database. None of
the hunderts of builtin MATLAB-functions will get differentiated, nor is it
possible to specify 
<A HREF="adimat-10.html#BMFUNC">BMFUNC ...</A> directives.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOCALMFILES, GLOBAL LOCALMFILES</B><DD><P>Matlab allows two sorts of files. Files containing a function and files
containing statements only. The former kind is not affected by this directive,
but the later. A statement file (called m-file here) causes a problem, when
called from more than one function. Different sets of variables may be active.
If the directive 'LOCALMFILES' is used, which is the default, each m-file will
be duplicated each time it is called from a function and the name of the
calling function is concatenated to the m-file name. This localises the m-file
and enables correct identification of the identifiers within the file. This
techinque is in alpha-state and therefore not applicable every time. If ADiMat
complains about missing identifiers and the project contains an m-file, then
the directive 'GLOBAL NOLOCALMFILES' may solve the problem. This directive
overrides the command line option '--nolocalmfiles'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL ENVOUTPUT</B><DD><P>Each identifier in the whole program is augmented with information of its
state within ADiMat. The output-files produced by ADiMat are no longer valid
MATLAB-files. The directive is for debuging purpose only.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOOPEROPTIM, GLOBAL OPEROPTIM</B><DD><P>These directives disable/ enable the use of an optimisation, if a binary
operator is used more than once successively to compute a derivative. Assume
the expression a* b* c is to be differentiated with respect to all three
variables. If the flag NOOPEROPTIM is set, then the derivative looks like
this: g_a* b* c+ a* g_b* c+ a* b *g_c. This code is not very efficient,
because each multiplication of a derivative object g_? with any over object
executes a loop for each operator. That is, for the example above 7 loops are
executed (the product of a* b contains no derivative object and no loop
therefore). Using the flag OPEROPTIM the above derivative expression will be
replaced with a function call and the number of loops executed will be
decreased significantly (currently five loops are executed, but in future
versions only one loop may be executed). The default is to use OPEROPTIM, the
ability to switch of the optimization of operator differentiation is merely a
tool for performance-meassurement. This directive overrides the command line
option '--nooperoptim'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOCALCSE, GLOBAL LOCALCSE</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="globalnolocalcse"></A> </P>
<P>Dis-/Enables local common subexpression elimination (cse). The transformation
is applied to all files if this statement is encountered anywhere. During the
canonicalisation step ADiMat may encounter that one subexpression is evaluated
several times. The code is transformed in a way that the subexpression is
evaluated only once and stored in a temporary variable. The temporary variable
is inserted into the code where a reevaluation of the subexpression would have
occurred. This directive switches off/on the optimization strategy. This may
be needed, if one of the subexpressions contained a function with sideeffects.
This directive implies setting the 
<A HREF="#globalnoglobalcse">GLOBAL NOGLOBALCSE</A> directive. The directive overrides '--nolocalcse',
'--localcse' and partially '--globalcse'. The latter one is only partially
overriden, because switching off local cse switches off global cse, too.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOGLOBALCSE, GLOBAL GLOBALCSE</B><DD><P>
<A NAME="globalnoglobalcse"></A> </P>
<P>Switches off/on global common subexpression elimination. ADiMat applies a
common subexpression elimination algorithm to the whole code after the
canonicalization step. This directive may be of use, if the code contains
functions with side effects. The resulting code may be incorrect. Try this
directive or the commandline option 
<A HREF="#noglobalcse">--noglobalcse</A> to check if the cse caused the problem. This directive
overrides '--noglobalcse', '--globalcse' and partially '--localcse'. The latter
one is overriden partially, because global cse needs local cse.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOLOOPSAVING, GLOBAL LOOPSAVING</B><DD><P>Disables/Enables optimized operators in derivative computations. During
computation of derivatives loops iterate over the number of derivatives. In
the derivative of a product three loops are run. The loopsaving operator, in
fact a function, combines these three loops to one single loop minimizing the
computational effort. It is highly recommended to use loopsaving
operators/functions. The loopsaving functions are denote by the 'ls_'-prefix.

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOOVERWRITINGCHECK, GLOBAL OVERWRITINGCHECK</B><DD><P>Disable/Enable the check for variable updates. A variable update is an
assignment to a variable <CODE>v</CODE> where the variable occurs on the right- and
left-hand side of the assignment. In fact, it is not only checked if an update
occured, but it is also prevented that the variable <CODE>v</CODE> is overwritten in
the same assignment it is used in. The motivation for this check is simply the
fact, that within the derivative expression of the assignment, the original
value of <CODE>v</CODE> before the update may be needed. This directive overrides the
option '--nooverwrtchk'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL SECONDORDERFWD, GLOBAL SECONDORDERFWDMD</B><DD><P>Compute Hessians along with the gradients. This directive switches on the
computation of second-order derivatives. </P>


<DT><B>GLOBAL PARENTCHECK, GLOBAL CANON_PARENTCHECK, GLOBAL POST_PARENTCHECK</B><DD><P>Check consistency of the AST. This is a debugging directive. See 
<A HREF="#parentcheck">--parentcheck</A> for more information.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOSCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL SCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL NOPRESCALARFOLDING,
GLOBAL PRESCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL NOPOSTSCALARFOLDING, GLOBAL POSTSCALARFOLDING</B><DD><P>Disable/Enable folding of constant real scalar expressions at transformation
time. Have a look at the commandline option for more information (see 
<A HREF="#noscalarfolding">--noscalarfolding</A>). These directives override:
'--noscalarfolding', '--noprescalarfolding', and '--nopostscalarfolding'.</P>

<DT><B>GLOBAL NOCONSTFOLDMULT0, GLOBAL CONSTFOLDMULT0</B><DD><P>If 
<A HREF="#noscalarfolding">scalarfolding</A> is enabled, then this

factor is zero. This directive overrides: '--noconstfoldmult0'.</P>

description look at the chapter

<P>NOTE! Each ADiMat-directive within a Matlab file has to be preceeded by
the string '%ADiMat ' exactly as written here. No space after the percent-sign
is allowed nor different combinations of upper- and lowercase letter in the
word ADiMat are allowed. Using this strict rule a directive may be switched of
by simply altering the case of one letter or inserting a space after the
percent-sign.</P>
