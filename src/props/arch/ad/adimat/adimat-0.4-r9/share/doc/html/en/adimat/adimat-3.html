<P>Matlab is a language for technical-mathematical computing. The language has a
huge number of syntactic constructs. Some are known from other languages like
C, Fortran and so on, some are Matlab-specific. Due to the huge number of
syntactic constructs implemented in Matlab and their sometimes slightly
different meaning in a specific context, not all language features
are completely implemented in ADiMat. That is, the syntactic constructs are
parsed, but their meaning is only partially or not at all known to ADiMat.
A warning message is printed, if ADiMat encounters an unknown construct, but
the differentiation process continues. If a warning about unknown
language features is printed, the differentiated code has to be checked. Below
is a list of the most commonly used Matlab features that are supported,
partially supported or not supported at all.
The lists below is subject to change as development of ADiMat continues. These
lists are set up at March 12 2002.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.1">Supported Matlab features</A>
</H2>

<P>These syntactic constructs are supported completely. Their differentiation is
tested. If you encounter any problems, tell the author immediately.</P>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<UL>
<LI> all mathematical operators like (&plus;, -, &ast;, /, ...)</LI>
<LI> real and complex values</LI>
<LI> vectors, matrices, structures and cell arrays</LI>
<LI> all flow control structures</LI>
<LI> multiple functions per project</LI>
<LI> local functions</LI>
<LI> global variables</LI>
<LI> indexing into matrices and cellarrays</LI>
<LI> access of data members of a structure</LI>
<LI> call of nargin/nargout-functions</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.2">Partially supported Matlab features</A>
</H2>

<P>Some features of Matlab are parsed by ADiMat, but they may not be treated
correctly. That is, the differentiated code may be incorrect. Whenever such
a feature is found, ADiMat issues a warning and continues its task. The
features, that are not completely implemented, are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<UL>
<LI> java function calls (will be treated as structures)</LI>
<LI> load- and save-command</LI>
<LI> call of shell-commands (!-operator)</LI>
<LI> calling a function omitting some (return-)parameters</LI>
<LI> varargin- and varargout-constructs</LI>
<LI> use of function handles (the @&lt;functionname&gt;-operator)</LI>
</UL>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="adimat.html#toc3.3">Matlab features not supported at all</A>
</H2>

<P>Some very special and complicated features are not implemented at all. These
constructs are:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<UL>
<LI> classes</LI>
<LI> private functions (Functions that reside in a private directory of the
current path.)</LI>
</UL>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>If you encounter a language construct that is not treated correctly by
ADiMat or not implemented at all, please tell the author about it.
