              QUICKINSTALLATION-GUIDE
	      =======================

Step 1:

If you copy this directory to '/usr/local' then you are nearly done. 

If this directory resides in '/new/location' then you have the set the
environment variable ADIMAT_HOME to '/new/location/adimat-0.4'. In the bash
and ksh shell this is done by:

export ADIMAT_HOME=/new/location/adimat-0.4

(Add this line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.kshrc, resp., to set it at startup time.)

in the (t)csh shell this is done by

setenv ADIMAT_HOME /new/location/adimat-0.4

(Add this line to ~/.cshrc to set it permanently.)

Step 2:
	
The last thing you have to do is copy the file  

share/adimat/opt_derivclass/ADiMat_startup.m 

to your ~/matlab directory and call the script from ~/matlab/startup.m by
adding the line:

ADiMat_startup

to the end of the ~/matlab/startup.m file. If ~/matlab/startup.m does not
exist yet, create it and add the line.
